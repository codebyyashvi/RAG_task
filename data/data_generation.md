# Data Generation Methodology

## Objective
The goal of this dataset is to provide a synthetic, structured, and semantically rich collection of documents suitable for evaluating Elasticsearch-based retrieval and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines.

## Data Source and Nature
The dataset is fully synthetic and does not contain copied or scraped content from external sources. All documents were created using domain knowledge of software systems, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and distributed architectures.

## Topic Selection
Topics were selected from commonly used technical domains, including:
- Elasticsearch and search systems
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- System design and distributed systems
- Cloud computing and DevOps
- Security and AI ethics

This ensures diversity while maintaining relevance for semantic search tasks.

## Content Creation Process
- Each document was written in original language and phrased in a clear, explanatory manner.
- Documents contain multiple sentences to provide sufficient semantic context.
- Titles and content were aligned to improve retrieval relevance.
- Tags were added to enhance metadata-based filtering and search accuracy.

## Dataset Characteristics
- Approximately 100 documents
- Consistent schema across all records
- Text-rich content optimized for semantic similarity search
- Suitable for keyword search, vector search, and RAG-based response generation

## Intended Usage
This dataset is intended for:
- Indexing into Elasticsearch 7.x
- Performing keyword and semantic search
- Serving as a knowledge base for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation pipeline
- Evaluating retrieval accuracy, relevance, and performance
